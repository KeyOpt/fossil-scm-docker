# Simple Container image for building fossil-scm

Configured to build the latest trunk version of fossil-scm by default, but you can specify a version with `make build VERSION=2.15` for instance.  Configured Makefile using buildx to build linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/386, linux/arm/v7, and linux/arm/v6.

Let me know if you see any room to improve it!
